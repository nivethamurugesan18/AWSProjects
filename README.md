AWS Serverless Architecture Lab using Lambda

Simplifying Infrastructure with AWS Serverless Architecture 🚀

Built a serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, and I'm excited to share the benefits and results! 💻

Key Components:
AWS Lambda 📈: Handles business logic for CRUD operations, allowing developers to focus on code without server management.
API Gateway 🚪: Securely handles HTTP requests and invokes Lambda functions.
DynamoDB 📊: Provides a scalable NoSQL database solution.

Benefits of Serverless Architecture:
Cost-effective 💸: Pay only for compute time used.
Highly scalable ⚖️: Automatically scales with incoming traffic.<img width="1025" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 7 24 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb85818d-6199-45f3-8f87-f13e935c8a29" />

Reduced management overhead 📉: Focus on code, not servers.

Real-World Use Case:
Built a performance load test with AWS Lambda. Created API calls using Postman 📨 that triggers API Gateway to invoke a Lambda function, which inserts data into DynamoDB 📈. This serverless architecture allows you to build scalable and cost-efficient business solutions without managing servers. API Gateway handles the HTTP requests, Lambda processes the business logic, and DynamoDB provides a scalable database solution.

Takeaways:
Simplified infrastructure reduces overhead and enhances scalability 🚀
Focus on writing code, not managing servers 💻
Cost optimization through pay-per-use models 📊
